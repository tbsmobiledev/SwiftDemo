# **Mobi Swift**

Mobi Swift is an application for iOS based on Swift language. Here you can check out various UI and functional elements usage and the optimised code required to perform various tasks.

  - Usage of various UI elements.
  - Coredata for offline storage.
  - Integrate Objective-C files using Bridge with header file.

### **Features!**

  - Implementation of UINavigation Controller and UITabBar Controller, UITableView, UICollectionView, Picker view, Progress view, XIBs, Animations and Visual effects with MVC architecture.
  - Integration of Third Party libraries for better User Experience.

You can also:
  - Sign up to the application and log in to your account to view more features.
  
### Project Structure:
To reduce code from ending up in same directory, the application project is split into different folders depending on the architecture. 
 - Models
 - Views
 - View Controllers
 - Helper class 
 - Storyboards and Xibs
 
#### User Interface:
The application uses various UITextfield, UITableView and UICollectionView delegate methods and a secure text entry for password. It even displays whether your password is Strong, Average or Weak.    
 
#### Data Storage:
NSUserDefaults and CoreData is used to store data locally and show how some of the CRUD operations are done in CoreData.
 
#### Localization:
It is always safe to use localization files. It is easy and less time consuming to translate when all the texts are in one place. Check out Localizable.strings file in the project for implementation and its usage.

#### Helper Class
It is a customised class saved in Third Party folder. It contains class type for accessing various features in the storyboard IBInspectable property for easy access to each functionality. It has type extension of String, View, View Controller and many more for new functionalities and code optimization.
